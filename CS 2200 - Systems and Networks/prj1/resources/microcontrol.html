<h1> Microcontrol Unit</h1>
<h3>CS2200 - Intro Systems and Networks</h3>

<p>You will make a Microcontrol Unit which will drive control of
the signal lines to the various items on the datapath.</p>

<p>FSM control units may be implemented in a number of ways:
Combinational logic combined with a state element such as a
register may be used. Quite common in practice are microcode
designs where the information for each state is stored in a ROM.
</p>

<p>As mentioned above, the simple, single-ROM solution has a lot
of wasted space in the ROM since most of the microstates do not
depend on the OP code or the Z register to determine which signals
to assert. For example, since Z register is an input for the
address, every microstate would have to have an address for Z = 0
as well as Z = 1, even though this only matters for one particular
microstate. </p>

<p>To solve this problem, we will use a three ROM
microcontroller. In this arrangement, we have three ROMs - the main
ROM, which outputs the control signals, the sequencer ROM, which
helps to determine which microstate to go at the end of the FETCH
state, and the OnZ ROM, which helps to determine whether or not to
branch during the BEQ instruction. See the following figure.
</p>

<p><b>Figure 3: Three ROM Microcontrol Unit</b></p>

<p>As you can see, there are three different locations that the
next state can come from - part of the output from the previous
state (main ROM), the sequencer ROM, and the OnZ ROM. The mux
controls which of these sources gets through to the state register.
If the previous state's "next state" field determines where to go,
neither the OPTest nor chkZ signals will be asserted. If the Op
Code from the IR determines the next state (such as at the end of
the Fetch state), the OpTest signal will be asserted. If the
zero-detection circuitry determines the next state (such as in the
BEQ instruction), the TestZ signal will be asserted. Note that
these two signals should never be asserted at the same
time since nothing is input into the "11" pin on the MUX.</p>

<p>The OpCheck ROM should have one address per
instruction, and the OnZ ROM should have one address for taking the
branch and one for not taking the branch. </p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> Logisim has a minimum of two address bits for a ROM (i.e. four addresses),
even though only one address bit (two addresses) is needed for the OnZ ROM. Just
ignore the other two addresses. You may want to do something so
that the high address bit for this ROM is permanently set to zero.
</p>

<p>Before getting down to specifics you need to determine the
control scheme for the datapath. To do this examine each
instruction, one by one, and construct a finite state bubble
diagram showing exactly what control signals will be set in each
state. Also determine what are the conditions necessary to pass
from one state to the next. Experiment with the supplied datapath
to make sure that your logic is sound. </p>

<p>Once the finite state bubble diagram is produced, the next
step is to encode the contents of the Control Unit ROM with a tool
we are providing. Then you must design and build (in Logisim)
the Control Unit circuit which will contain the three ROMs, a MUX,
and a state register. Your design will be better if it allows you
to single step and insure that it is working properly. Finally, you
will load the Control Unit's ROMs with the output of the tool.

control logic: </p>
