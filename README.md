GTCourseWork
============
A compendium of random work I have done as a student in Georgia Tech's Computer Science program

### Disclaimer
I'm not at liberty to discuss how to use any of the code written in this repo works. This is mostly a personal backup of schoolwork, not a guide on how to solve the problems for your particular course. I assume the problems that are presented to you in class may have been changed since my time at GT, which I cannot guarantee if the code or information in this repo is adequate at solving.
